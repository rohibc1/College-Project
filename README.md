Face recognition technology can detect peopleâ€™s faces in live video streams or video footage and store anonymous information for each appearance of a person in front of a camera. Analysis of this information over time allows the software to compute people count, demographical information, people movement in time and space, and to detect frequent visitors and crowds.
